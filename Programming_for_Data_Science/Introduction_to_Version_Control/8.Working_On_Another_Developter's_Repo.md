# Working_On_Another_Developter's_Repo

## Intro

### Forking a repository

### Reviewing another developer's changes

### Knowing what changes to make






## Forking A Repository

### Fork
> To split into an identical copy

> make a copy of that repository and bring it over to my own account.


### Push/Pull To The Fork
Because forking a repository gives you a copy of it in your account, you can clone at down to your computer, make changes to it, and then push those changes back to the forked repository. But you need to keep in mind that it'll be pushing the changes back to your remote repository not to the original remote repository that you forked from.

### Recap
Forking is an action that's done on a hosting service, like GitHub. Forking a repository creates an identical copy of the original repository and moves this copy to your account. You have total control over this forked repository. Modifying your forked repository does not alter the original repository in any way.


## Reviewing Existing Work

### Reviewing Existing Work
When you're the sole developer on a project, it's easy to know what progress has been done on the project because you did everything yourself. Things can become a bit more complicated, though, when you're working on a team - whether that team is local in an office or if you are developing with someone just across the internet.

Sometimes it can be hard to see what the other developers have been doing on the project. Especially if developers are working across multiple different branches. How can I see all of the commits that Deepesh made? Or what if Christine made a change and said that her commit resolves issue 47 in our project's ticket tracking system. How can we discover the all of this information in the repository?

We can discover details about what other developers have done by using the extremely powerful git log command.

#### Clone Lighthouse Project
We first need to download a project that is being worked on by multiple different people. Let's download the Lighthouse project by Google that's an app for auditing, performance metrics, and best practices for Progressive web apps.

Here's the Lighthouse project on GitHub.
https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse

### Filtering Collaborator's Commits
Being able to narrow down the commits to just the ones you're looking for can be a chore. Let's look at the different ways we can discover information that our collaborators have done!

### Group By Commit Author
This is not a massive project, but it does have well over 1,000 commits. A quick way that we can see how many commits each contributor has added to the repository is to use the git shortlog command:

    $ git shortlog
    


In the screenshot above we can see that:

* Abby Armada has made one commit in the repository
* Addy Osmani has made seven commits
* Adriano Caheté has made one commit
* André Cipriani Bandarra has made one commit

git shortlog displays an alphabetical list of names and the commit messages that go along with them. If we just want to see just the number of commits that each developer has made, we can add a couple of flags: -s to show just the number of commits (rather than each commit's message) and -n to sort them numerically (rather than alphabetically by author name).

    $ git shortlog -s -n


e can see in the image above that Surma has added five commits to the Lighthouse project. These five commits are spread out throughout the repository. What if we want to see just these five commits by Surma, though?

#### Filter By Author
Another way that we can display all of the commits by an author is to use the regular git log command but include the --author flag to filter the commits to the provided author.

    $ git log --author=Surma



#### ⚠️ Quotes Are Important ⚠️
Pay attention to the use of the quotes in the previous command. If it were written without the quotes like this git log --author=Paul Lewis, it would not work. If it's formatted this way without the quotes, Git would think that Lewis is not part of the "author" flag, and it would cause an error.


### Filter Commits By Search
Before going through this section on filtering by searching, I feel like I need to stress how important it is to write good, descriptive commit messages. If you write a descriptive commit message, then it's so much easier to search through the commit messages, later, to find exactly what you're looking for.

And remember, if the commit message is not enough for you to explain what the commit is for, you can provide a detailed description of exactly why the commit is needed in the description area.

Let see an example of extra details in a commit in the lighthouse project by looking at commit 5966b66:

    $ git show 5966b66


The commit message is Configure Lighthouse run by whitelisting aggregations (#1830). But there's a lot more text than just that. Beneath the commit message, you'll find a couple of lines with additional information about the commit. This section provides further information on the why this commit was needed.

So why do we care about all of this detail? For one thing, it's easier for you to go back and review the changes made to the repository, and it easier for others to review the changes to. Another thing is filtering commits by information in the current message or description area.

We can filter commits with the --grep flag.

How about we filter down to just the commits that reference the word "bug". We can do that with either of the following commands:

$ git log --grep=bug
$ git log --grep bug

### ⚠️ Watch Out For Spacing ⚠️

> Remember that spacing is an issue, here, too. If you're trying to search for something that is multiple words and has spaces between the words, you need to wrap everything in quotes. For example, to search for unit tests you would need to use the following command, git log --grep="unit tests".

### 💡 More On grep 💡

> If you don't know what grep is then the --grep flag might not seem like a logical choice for the flag's name. Grep is a pattern matching tool. It is way beyond the scope of this course to cover grep. But as a brief intro, if you were to run git log --grep "fort", then Git will display only the commits that have the character f followed by the character o followed by r followed by t.


### Recap

The git log command is extremely powerful, and you can use it to discover a lot about a repository. But it can be especially helpful to discover information about a repository that you're collaborating on with others. You can use git log to:

* group commits by author with git shortlog

    $ git shortlog

* filter commits with the --author flag

    $ git log --author="Richard Kalehoff"

* filter commits using the --grep flag

    $ git log --grep="border radius issue in Safari"

grep is a complicated topic and you can find out more about it.






## Determining What To Work On

### What To Work On
Let's say you're using some third-party library to help you build a project. What happens if, while you're using this third-party library, you come across a bug or a misspelling? You have the skill to be able to fix it, but you don't have direct access to make modifications to the original library. Well that's not a problem because you know that forking another developer's repository copies it to your account and gives you full access to git pull and git push to it!

But what are you supposed to do now that you've got full access to a duplicate of the other developer's project. We'll look at this in the next section but if you have forked a project and you have code in your fork that's not in the original project, you can get code into the original project by sending the original project's maintainer a request to include your code changes. This request is known as a "Pull Requests". Again, we'll look at sending and working with pull requests in the next lesson.

So you know it's possible to get your code in the original project and you know you want to help and fix this spelling/code mistake. So you got something to work on! But how do you go about actually contributing to the project in the way that the original project maintainer will be happy with and will end up actually incorporating your changes?

The first thing you should always look for in a project is a file with the name CONTRIBUTING.md.

### CONTRIBUTING.md File

The name of the CONTRIBUTING.md file is typically written in all caps so that it's easily seen. As you could probably tell by its name, this file lists out the information you should follow to contribute to the project. You should look for this file before you start doing development work of any kind.


You can see that the top line of the file says:

> We'd love your help! This doc covers how to become a contributor and submit code to the project.

There are two main sections to this file:

* the "For Contributors" section
* the "For Maintainers" section

Each one of these sections has subsections of its own to instruct readers on how to contribute to and work with this project.

Let's take a look at the section on signing the contributors license. Here's what it looks like at the time of making the course:


### GitHub Issues
If your code change is a simple spelling mistake then you can probably just go ahead and make that change. But if your change is more substantial where it modifies a number of files in a significant way, then you probably want to get approval by the project's maintainer(s) before you start working on it. You definitely don't want to spend a couple hours making changes to the project only to find out that someone else is doing the exact same thing. You'd just be wasting a lot of time and energy duplicating work.

In a CONTRIBUTING.md file it explains how your code should be formatted and the steps you should go about to contribute, but how do you know what you should contribute? You should talk to the project maintainers directly. GitHub has a fantastic interface for asking questions of the project maintainer in an open way that lets everyone see what's being done with the project.

Now, "issues" doesn't mean that there's actually a bug, it can just be any change that needs to be made to the project. GitHub's issue tractor is quite sophisticated. Each issue can:

* have a label or multiple labels applied to it
* can be assigned to an individual
* can be assigned a milestone (for example the issue will be resolved by the next major release)

But probably one of the most important aspects of the issue tracker is that each issue can have its own comments, so a conversation can form around the issue.

Another thing that's nice about issues is:

they let you subscribe to an issue so you'll be notified of new comments and code changes
you can communicate back and forth with a project maintainer on a specific change
Before you contribute anything to a file, check out the instructions in CONTRIBUTING.md. Then check out the project's issues and look to see if there's anything that's similar to what you want to contribute. If there is, then subscribe to that issue and read the existing conversation to see if you can help.

If you've looked through the list of issues and don't see one that similar to what you want to do, then you can create a new issue of your own.

### New Issue Page

One really cool thing about the new issue page is that, if the project has a CONTRIBUTING.md file, it will display a notification at the top of the page recommending that you check out the guidelines on how to contribute to the project. Clicking on the "guidelines for contributing" link takes you to the CONTRIBUTING.md file.

The GitHub issues interface support markdown so when you create your issue you can use Markdown to format it and exactly the way you want by including links, images, bulleted lists, and code blocks.

### 💡 Learn Markdown! 💡
> From the README file, to the New Issue Page, to commenting, Markdown is incredibly important! If you're new to Markdown, we discuss everything about it in our Writing READMEs course. It's short, so why not take an hour to learn this incredible skill!

Just like crafting a descriptive commit message, you want to create an issue with an informative title that explains briefly what you want to do. Then, in the comments section, provide plenty of detail on what the change is, or why you think it's needed, or how this will make the project better.

Typically, the project's maintainer has a full-time job and works on their project on the side, so give them some time to respond to your issue before you dive in and start making your changes. Once the project maintainer has given you the go-ahead it's time to start working on the changes you want to contribute back to the project.


### Topic Branches
The best way to organize the set of commits/changes you want to contribute back to the project is to put them all on a topic branch. Now what do I mean by a topic branch? Unlike the master branch which is the default branch that holds all of the commits for your entire project, a topic branch host commits for just a single concept or single area of change.

For example if there is a problem with the login form for logging into the website, then a branch name to address this specific issue could be called:

* login
* login-bug
* signup-bug
* login-form-bug
* etc.

There are plenty of names that can be used for a topic branch's name. You just want to use a clear descriptive name for the branch so that if, for example, you list out all of the branches you can immediately see what changes are supposed to be in a branch just by its name.

One thing to keep in mind is that sometimes a project has specific requirements on what to name your topic branch. For example, if a branch is going to be addressing bug fixes, then many projects require a bugfix- prefix. Going back to our branch that was dealing with a bug with the login form, it would have to be named something like bugfix-login-form. So definitely check out the CONTRIBUTING.md file to see if they provide instructions on what you should name your topic branches.

### Best Practices

#### Write Descriptive Commit Messages

While we're talking about naming branches clearly that describe what changes the branch contains, I need to throw in another reminder about how critical it is to write clear, descriptive, commit messages. The more descriptive your branch name and commit messages are the more likely it is that the project's maintainer will not have to ask you questions about the purpose of your code or have dig into the code themselves. The less work the maintainer has to do, the faster they'll include your changes into the project.

#### Create Small, Focused Commits

This has been stressed numerous times before but make sure when you are committing changes to the project that you make smaller commits. Don't make massive commits that record 10+ file changes and changes to hundreds of lines of code. You want to make smaller, more frequent commits that record just a handful of file changes with a smaller number of line changes.

Think about it this way: if the developer does not like a portion of the changes you're adding to a massive commit, there's no way for them to say, "I like commit A, but just not the part where you change the sidebar's background color." A commit can't be broken down into smaller chunks, so make sure your commits are in small enough chunks and that each commit is focused on altering just one thing. This way the maintainer can say I like commits A, B, C, D, and F but not commit E.

#### Update The README

And lastly if any of the code changes that you're adding drastically changes the project you should update the README file to instruct others about this change.



### Recap
Before you start doing any work, make sure to look for the project's CONTRIBUTING.md file.

Next, it's a good idea to look at the GitHub issues for the project

* look at the existing issues to see if one is similar to the change you want to contribute
* if necessary create a new issue
* communicate the changes you'd like to make to the project maintainer in the issue

When you start developing, commit all of your work on a topic branch:

* do not work on the master branch
* make sure to give the topic branch clear, descriptive name

As a general best practice for writing commits:

* make frequent, smaller commits
* use clear and descriptive commit messages
*  update the README file, if necessary
