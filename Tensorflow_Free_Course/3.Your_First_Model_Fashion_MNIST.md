# Your First Modell - Fashion MNIST

## Interview with Sebastian

" What frontiers and challenges do you think are going to be the most impactful for deep learning in the next 10 years? "
> I Would say two things.
> One is a more general intelligence training in network to do more than one task. 
> People can do more than one task and never should do the same thing.
>
> The second is bring it to market. 
> The great vision of machine learning is that it allows computer to observe, expose with them their work, 
> and they pick up the patterns and help other people to be as good as the best experts.
> So it could be done in law, medicine, driving cars.

" What applications are you most excited about seeing machine learning applied to ? "

> A lot, a lot. Medical is very high on the list.
> I think there are a lot of diseases if they could detect them early, like cancer, they could have much better treatment.
> The same is true for Alzheimer, and for congestive heart failure, where there's actually ideas to bring instrument to the house in some smart way, using machine learning, deep learning to detect these things before even people will detect them.
>
> I'd say anything repetitive, anything office work where you do the same stuff over again, like accountants, for example, lawyers .

" Can you tell us a little bit more about what you think of dense layers? "

> Well, so every network can be connected differnetly. Some of them have a very sparse connectivity which gives you better scalability so you can beat larger nerworks.
> Sometimes you don't quite know the Internet things from the beginning, so you connect everything with everything. 
> That's called dense layer, and it's actually a much more potent learning machine than something that's more structured.


## Introduction

### Regression predicts a numeric value

We will create a neural network that can recognize items of clothing and images.

## Fashion MNIST Dataset

* consist of 28 by 28 pixel gray-scale images of clothing
* contains images of t-shrits and tops, sandals, and even ankle boots
