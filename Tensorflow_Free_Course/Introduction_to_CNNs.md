# Introduction to CNN 

## Interview with Sebastian 

" I know that you've done a lot of research with convolutional neural networks. Can you tell us a little bit more about what they are? "

> So convolutional networks are a very smart way to a structure in network, and built tin this was called an invariance.
> So for example, if you take the idea of a scence of recognition, you have an image in front of you and want to understand "is Sebastian in the image? " 
> The recognition of my head, my face, is the same no matter where you are.
> That invariance, that's a kind of location variance, is hard-coded using convolution neural networks.
>
> So you have a repetition in the network, the structure in network and make sure of whatever you learn for the corner of that image works up here.
>

" So can you tell us a little bit about some of the application that you can see for CNN's? "

> People have used some massively for anything in image and video, includiing medical imaging.
> They are also being used now for language technologies, where people use deep learning for understanding and to replicate in language, and the applications here are limitless.
