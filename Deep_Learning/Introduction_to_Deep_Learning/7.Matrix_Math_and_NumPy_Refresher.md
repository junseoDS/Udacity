# Matrix Math and NumPy Refresher

## Introduction 

Deep learning involves a lot of matrix math, and itâ€™s important for you to understand the basics before diving into building your own neural networks. These lessons provide a short refresher on what you need to know for this course, along with some guidance for using the [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) library to work efficiently with matrices in Python.


## Data Dimensions

### Scalars
a single value
> Scalars have zero dimensons 

### Vectors
lists of values
two types : row vectors , column vectors.
> 1 dimension : length

### Matrices 
> A Matrix is a 2 dimensional grid of values

### Tensors
> Tensor can refer to any n-dimensional collection of values
