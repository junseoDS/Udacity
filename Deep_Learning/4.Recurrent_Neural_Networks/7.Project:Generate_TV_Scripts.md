# Generate TV Scripts

## Introduction

In this project, you'll generate your own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. You'll be using a Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network you'll build will generate a new, "fake" TV script.


### Advanced Projects

After completing this project, try applying what you learned to one of these problems.

* Generate your own Bach music using like [DeepBach](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.01010.pdf).
* Predict seizures in intracranial EEG recordings on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/seizure-prediction).
