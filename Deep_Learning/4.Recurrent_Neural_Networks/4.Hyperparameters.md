# Hyperparameters


## Introducing Jay


For this section, we're introducing a new Udacity instructor, Jay Alammar. Jay has done some great work in interactive explorations of neural networks, check out [his blog](http://jalammar.github.io/).

Jay will be reviewing some of the material you saw in the Deep Neural Networks section on hyperparameters, and he will also introduce the hyperparameters used in Recurrent Neural Networks.
