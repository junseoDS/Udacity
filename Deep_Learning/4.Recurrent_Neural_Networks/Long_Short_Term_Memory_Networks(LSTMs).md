# Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs)


## Intro to LSTM

Hi! It's Luis again!

Now that you've gone through the Recurrent Neural Network lesson, I'll be teaching you what an LSTM is. This stands for Long Short Term Memory Networks, and are quite useful when our neural network needs to switch between remembering recent things, and things from long time ago. But first, I want to give you some great references to study this further. There are many posts out there about LSTMs, here are a few of my favorites:

* [Chris Olah's LSTM post](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/)
* [Edwin Chen's LSTM post](http://blog.echen.me/2017/05/30/exploring-lstms/)
* [Andrej Karpathy's lecture on RNNs and LSTMs from CS231n](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iX5V1WpxxkY)

So, let's dig in!
