## Applications of CNNs

" CNNs achieve state of the art results in a variety of proble areas including Voice User Interfaces, Natural Language Process, and Computer vision."

### Optional Resources
* Read about [the WaveNet model](https://deepmind.com/blog/wavenet-generative-model-raw-audio/).

  * Why train an A.I. to talk, when you can train it to sing ;)? In April 2017, researchers used a variant of the WaveNet model to generate songs. The original paper and demo can be found here.


* Learn about CNNs for [text classification](http://www.wildml.com/2015/12/implementing-a-cnn-for-text-classification-in-tensorflow/).

  * You might like to sign up for the author's [Deep Learning Newsletter](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/wildml)!


* Read about Facebook's [novel CNN approach](https://code.fb.com/ml-applications/a-novel-approach-to-neural-machine-translation/) for language translation that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy at nine times the speed of RNN models.


* Play [Atari games](https://deepmind.com/research/dqn/) with a CNN and reinforcement learning. You can [download](https://sites.google.com/a/deepmind.com/dqn/) the code that comes with this paper.

  * If you would like to play around with some beginner code (for deep reinforcement learning), you're encouraged to check out Andrej Karpathy's [post](http://karpathy.github.io/2016/05/31/rl/).


* Play [pictionary](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/#) with a CNN!

  * Also check out all of the other cool implementations on the [A.I. Experiments website](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/collection/ai). Be sure not to miss [AutoDraw](https://www.autodraw.com/)!


* Read more about [AlphaGo](https://deepmind.com/research/alphago/).

  * Check out [this article](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/604273/finding-solace-in-defeat-by-artificial-intelligence/?set=604287), which asks the question: If mastering Go “requires human intuition,” what is it like to have a piece of one’s humanity challenged?

* Check out these really cool videos with drones that are powered by CNNs.

  * Here's an interview with a startup - [Intelligent Flying Machines (IFM)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMDiR61f86Y).
  * Outdoor autonomous navigation is typically accomplished through the use of the [global positioning system (GPS)](https://www.droneomega.com/gps-drone-navigation-works/), but here's a demo with a CNN-powered [autonomous drone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSFYOw4VIYY).


* If you're excited about using CNNs in self-driving cars, you're encouraged to check out:

  * our [Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013), where we classify signs in the [German Traffic Sign dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset) in this [project](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project).
  * our [Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009t), where we classify house numbers from the [Street View House Numbers](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/) dataset in this [project](https://github.com/udacity/machine-learning/tree/master/projects/digit_recognition).
  * this [series of blog posts](https://pythonprogramming.net/game-frames-open-cv-python-plays-gta-v/) that details how to train a CNN in Python to produce a self-driving A.I. to play Grand Theft Auto V.

* Check out some additional applications not mentioned in the video.

  * Some of the world's most famous paintings have been [turned into 3D](https://www.businessinsider.com/3d-printed-works-of-art-for-the-blind-2016-1) for the visually impaired. Although the article does not mention how this was done, we note that it is possible to use a CNN to [predict depth](https://cs.nyu.edu/~deigen/depth/) from a single image.
  * Check out [this research](https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/03/assisting-pathologists-in-detecting.html) that uses CNNs to localize breast cancer.
  * CNNs are used to [save endangered species](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2016/11/04/saving-endangered-species/?adbsc=social_20170303_70517416)!
  * An app called [FaceApp](https://www.digitaltrends.com/photography/faceapp-neural-net-image-editing/) uses a CNN to make you smile in a picture or change genders.
