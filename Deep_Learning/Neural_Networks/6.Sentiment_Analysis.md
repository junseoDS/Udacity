## Meet Andrew

> Deep learning is that take what you know and predict what you want to know using network.
>
> Sentiment classification of the classification of whether or not a section of human generated text is positive or negative. 
>
> Framing a problem , so the network can be successful in discovering correlation between your input and your output data. 
>
> Transform our textual input data into numerical form in such a way that the neural network can easily discover the correlation. 
>
> This tutorial is going to be broken into 6 differnt projects
>
> * Curating your dataset
> * Coming up with a predictive theory for where we think the correlation exists in our dataset
> * Validate the theory 
> * Transfrom it into your input output data 
> * Iterate several times
> * Try to increase the amount of correlation that our neural networks are able to find in a smaller period of time.
> * At the end, tear apart our neural networks and check out the weights to really understand what's going on when we're back propagating, to try to solve assignment .
