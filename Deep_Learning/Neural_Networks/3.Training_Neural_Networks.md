## Training Optimization 

""" 
Somtimes we go out there and train on ourselves and find out that nothing works as planned. 

Why? Because there are many things that can fail.

Our architecture can be poorly chosen

Our data can be noisy

Our model couold maybe be taking years to run and need it to run faster. 

We need to learn ways to optimize the training of our models and this is what we'll do next.
