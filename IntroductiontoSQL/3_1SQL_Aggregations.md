# LESSION 3 : SQL Aggregations

## intro

What I learned earlier

> * Concept 1 : LEFT, RIGHT and INNER JOINs
> * Concept 2 : Filter result with WHERE and ON clauses

Somtimes row-level data could be overwhlming

A single number (aggregated) can be more valuable

Similiar syntax with Exel

> COUNT, SUM, MIN, MAX, AVERAGE

> Operating down columns

### NULL

Null : No data

to find null

    WHERE --- IS NULL
    
or

    WHERE --- NOT NULL

Null is not value, *it's property of data

Two common ways in which I'm likely to encounter NULLs :

> * Performing LEFT or RIGHT JOIN

> * Simply missing data in database
