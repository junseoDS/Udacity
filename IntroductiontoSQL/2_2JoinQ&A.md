=> should use alias when colnames are same

Q3.

Your final table should have 3 columns: region name, account name, and unit price. A few accounts have 0 for total, so I divided by (total + 0.01) to assure not dividing by zero.


A3.
SELECT r.name AS region_name , a.name AS account_name, o.total_amt_usd/(o.total+0.01) AS unit_price
FROM orders AS o
JOIN accounts AS a
ON o.account_id=a.id

In order to avoid a division by zero error, adding .01 to the denominator here is helpful total_amt_usd/(total+0.01).
