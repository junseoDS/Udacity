## Your First Window Function

create a running total of standard_amt_usd (in the orders table) over order time with no date truncation. 
Your final table should have two columns: one with the amount being added for each new row, and a second with the running total.

### Answer

SELECT standard_amt_usd , SUM(standard_amt_usd) OVER(ORDER BY occurred_at) AS running_total
FROM orders
