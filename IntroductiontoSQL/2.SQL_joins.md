# LESSON 2 : SQL joins


Database Normalization

Aims
1. Are the tables storing logical groupings of data?
2. Can I make changes in a single location, rather than in many tables for the same information?
3. Can I access and manipulate date quickly and effiecntly?


## Inner JOIN

JOIN : Tells query an addtional table From which you would like to pull data

ON   : Specifies a logical statement to combine the table in FROM and JOIN statements


Specify tables and columns by
1. the table name is always before period.
2. the column you want from that table is always after the period.

ERD : Entity Relationship Diagram

## PK and FK

PK : Primary Key

    A primary key exits in every table , and it's a column that has unique value for every row
    
FK : Foreign Key
    
    A foreign key is a column in one table that is primary key in a different table
    

## JOIN two SQL query
*One in the FROM

*the other in the JOIN

*ON, always pk equals to the FK

# Alias

*Give table names alias, alias for a table will be created in the FROM or JOIN

*AS statement or space bar



### Inner join vs Left join vs Right join vs Full outer join

SELECT *

FROM left table

LEFT JOIN right table



# JOIN and filtering
WHERE     : shows and the result that condition is true

ON, AND   : mark given condition and show all data
