    "## Third-Party Libraries\n",
    "There are tens of thousands of third-party libraries written by independent developers! You can install them using pip, a package manager that is included with Python 3. pip is the standard package manager for Python, but it isn't the only one. One popular alternative is Anaconda which is designed specifically for data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "To install a package using pip, just enter \"pip install\" followed by the name of the package in your command line like this: pip install package_name. This downloads and installs the package so that it's available to import in your programs. Once installed, you can import third-party packages using the same syntax used to import from the standard library.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using a requirements.txt File\n",
    "Larger Python programs might depend on dozens of third party packages. To make it easier to share these programs, programmers often list a project's dependencies in a file called requirements.txt. This is an example of a requirements.txt file.\n",

    "    requests==2.11.1\n",
    "\n",
    "Each line of the file includes the name of a package and its version number. The version number is optional, but it usually should be included. Libraries can change subtly, or dramatically, between versions, so it's important to use the same library versions that the program's author used when they wrote the program.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Useful Third-Party Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "Being able to install and import third party libraries is useful, but to be an effective programmer you also need to know what libraries are available for you to use.

If you're a new Python programmer you may not have many colleagues, so to get you started here's a list of packages that are popular with engineers at Udacity.\n",

    "* IPython - A better interactive Python interpreter\n",

    "* Django - A more featureful framework for making web applications. Django is particularly good for designing complex, content heavy, web applications.\n",
    "* Beautiful Soup - Used to parse HTML and extract information from it. Great for web scraping.\n",
    "* pytest - extends Python's builtin assertions and unittest module.\n",
    "* PyYAML - For reading and writing YAML files.\n",
    "* NumPy - The fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things a powerful N-dimensional array object and useful linear algebra capabilities.\n",

    "* matplotlib - a 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments.\n",

    "Here are some techniques for effective web searching:\n",

    "* Try using keywords found on the pages you found in your initial search to direct the search engine to better resources in the subsequent search.\n",
    "* Copy and paste error messages to use as search terms. This will lead you to explanations of the error and potential causes. An error message might include references to specific line numbers of code that you wrote. Only include the part of the error message that comes before this in your search.\n",
    "* If you can't find an answer to your question, ask it yourself! Communities like StackOverflow have etiquette rules you must learn if you want to participate, but don't let this stop you from using these resources."

    "### Hierarchy of Online Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "While there are many online resources about programming, not all of the them are created equal. This list of resources is in approximate order of reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The Python Tutorial - This section of the official documentation surveys Python's syntax and standard library. It uses examples, and is written using less technical language than the main documentation. Make sure you're reading the Python 3 version of the docs!\n",
    "https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The Python Language and Library References - The Language Reference and Library Reference are more technical than the tutorial, but they are the definitive sources of truth. As you become increasingly acquainted with Python you should use these resources more and more.\n",
    "https://docs.python.org/3/index.html\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Third-Party Library Documentation - Third-party libraries publish their documentation on their own websites, and often times at https://readthedocs.org/. You can judge the quality of a third-party library by the quality of its documentation. If the developers haven't found time to write good docs, they probably haven't found the time to polish their library either.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The websites and blogs of prominent experts - The previous resources are primary sources, meaning that they are documentation from the same people who wrote the code being documented. Primary sources are the most reliable. Secondary sources are also extremely valuable. The difficulty with secondary sources is determining the credibility of the source. The websites of authors like Doug Hellmann and developers like Eli Bendersky are excellent. The blog of an unknown author might be excellent, or it might be rubbish.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. StackOverflow - This question and answer site has a good amount of traffic, so it's likely that someone has asked (and someone has answered) a related question before! However, answers are provided by volunteers and vary in quality. Always understand solutions before putting them into your program. One line answers without any explanation are dubious. This is a good place to find out more about your question or discover alternative search terms.\n",
    "https://stackoverflow.com/\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Bug Trackers - Sometimes you'll encounter a problem so rare, or so new, that no one has addressed it on StackOverflow. You might find a reference to your error in a bug report on GitHub for instance. These bug reports can be helpful, but you'll probably have to do some original engineering work to solve the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Random Web Forums - Sometimes your search yields references to forums that haven't been active since 2004, or some similarly ancient time. If these are the only resources that address your problem, you should rethink how you're approaching your solution."
