# Staying In Sync With A Remote Repository


## Intro

### Create a pull request

### Retrieve and sync updates

### Develop on an active pull request

### Squash commits



## Create a Pull Request

A pull request is a request to the original or source repository's maintainer to include changes in their project that you made in your fork of their project. You are requesting that they pull in changes you've made.


As long as you following the steps we covered in the previous section on:

* reviewing the project's CONTRIBUTING.md file
* checking out the project's existing issues
* talking with the project maintainer

...your pull request is sure to be included!

### Recap
A pull request is a request for the source repository to pull in your commits and merge them with their project. To create a pull request, a couple of things need to happen:

you must fork the source repository
clone your fork down to your machine
make some commits (ideally on a topic branch!)
push the commits back to your fork
create a new pull request and choose the branch that has your new commits

## Stay in sync with source project

### Stars & Watching
If you want to keep up-to-date with the Repository, GitHub offers a convenient way to keep track of repositories - it lets you star repositories

Starring is helpful if you want to keep track of certain repositories. But it's not entirely helpful if you need to actively keep up with a repositories development because you have to manually go to the stars page to view the repositories and see if they've changed.

### 💡 Stars & Popularity 💡

> Starring can be a useful feature to help you keep track of repositories you're interested in. But stars have also turned into a means of measuring a repo's popularity.

> If you'd rather not increase a repository's stars, then check out "watching" a repository. Let's look at that right now!

### Watching A Repository
If you need to keep up with a project's changes and want to be notified of when things change, GitHub offers a "Watch" feature.

If you're working on a repository quite often, then I'd suggest setting the watch setting to "Watching". This way GitHub will notify you whenever anything happens with the repository like people pushing changes to the repository, new issues being created, or comments being added to existing issues.


### Including Upstream Changes
Now that you know about watching your repository let say that you're watching it and you get notified that some commits have been pushed to the original, source repository. How do you go about getting those changes into your fork of the repository? If you want to keep doing development on your fork then you'd need your fork to stay in sync with the source repository as much as possible.


Remember that the word origin is just the default name that's used when you git clone a remote repository for the first time. We're going to use the git remote command to add a new shortname and URL to this list. This will give us a connection to the source repository.

    $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/udacity/course-collaboration-travel-plans.git

Notice that I've used the name upstream as the shortname to reference the source repository. As with the origin shortname, the word upstream here is not special in any way; It's just a regular word. This could have been any word... like the word "banana". But the word "upstream" is typically used to refer to the source repository.

### Origin vs Upstream Clarification
One thing that can be a tiny bit confusing right now is the difference between the origin and upstream. What might be confusing is that origin does not refer to the source repository (also known as the "original" repository) that we forked from. Instead, it's pointing to our forked repository. So even though it has the word origin is not actually the original repository.

Remember that the names origin and upstream are just the default or de facto names that are used. If it's clearer for you to name your origin remote mine and the upstream remote source-repo, then by all means, go ahead and rename them. What you name your remote repositories in your local repository does not affect the source repository at all.

### ⚠️ Resetting Remote Names ⚠️
> The image above demos the renaming of the remotes, but I have returned them to their default/defacto names of origin and upstream with the following commands:

    $ git remote rename mine origin
    $ git remote rename source-repo upstream


### Retrieving Upstream Changes
Now to get the changes from upstream remote repository, all we have to do is run a git fetch and use the upstream shortname rather than the origin shortname:

    $ git fetch upstream master


Now that we've fetched all of the changes from the upstream remote repository, let's do a log to see what new information we have in our local repository. I'm using the following git log command to make sure I display all commits from all branches (including remote and tracking branches!):

    $ git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all


It can be a bit difficult to read with the wrapping of the commit messages but you should be able to see that there is now an upstream/master remote branch that is ahead of the local master branch. upstream/master is on commit 52e493f while the master branch is on commit 1c12194.

We can use the upstream/master branch to keep track of where the source repository's master branch is. We can now get any changes that are made to the source repository's master branch by just running git fetch upstream master.


To push these new changes from the Lam's repository, we don't want to run git push origin upstream/master because upstream/master is not a local branch. To get these changes into my forked version of her project, I could merge upstream/master into an existing branch (like the local master branch) and push that.

    # to make sure I'm on the correct branch for merging
    $ git checkout master

    # merge in Lam's changes
    $ git merge upstream/master

    # send Lam's changes to *my* remote
    $ git push origin master


### Recap
When working with a project that you've forked. The original project's maintainer will continue adding changes to their project. You'll want to keep your fork of their project in sync with theirs so that you can include any changes they make.

To get commits from a source repository into your forked repository on GitHub you need to:

* get the cloneable URL of the source repository
* create a new remote with the git remote add command
  * use the shortname upstream to point to the source repository
  * provide the URL of the source repository
* fetch the new upstream remote
* merge the upstream's branch into a local branch
* push the newly updated local branch to your origin repo



## Manage an active PR

The project maintainer may decide not to accept your changes right away. They might request you to make some additional changes to your code before accepting your request and merging in your changes. Most likely they will communicate their desired changes through the conversation on the pull requests page.


One thing that I've grown to love about both the Git command line tool and the GitHub interface is how helpful they are with recommendations on what to do next. Near the bottom of the comments, there's a suggestion by GitHub that tells us how to add more commit; we need to add them to the same branch and push to my fork:

> Add more commits by pushing to the include-richards-destinations branch on richardkalehoff/course-collaboration-travel-plan.


When you submit a pull request, remember that you're asking another developer to add your code changes to their project. If they ask you to make some minor (even major!) changes to your pull request, that doesn't mean they're rejecting your work! It just means that they would like the code added to their project in a certain way.


The CONTRIBUTING.md file should be used to list out all information that the project's maintainer wants, so make sure to follow the information there. But that doesn't mean there might be times where the project's maintainer will ask you to do a few additional things.


So what should you do? Well, if you want your pull request to be accepted, then you make the change! Remember that the tab in GitHub is called the "Conversation" tab. So feel free to communicate back and forth with the project's maintainer to clarify exactly what they want you to do.


It also wouldn't hurt to thank them for taking the time to look over your pull request. Most of the developers that are working on open source projects are doing it unpaid. So remember to:


* be kind - the project's maintainer is a regular person just like you
* be patient - they will respond as soon as they are able


So Lam is asking that I combine my changes together before she'll merge in my pull request. Combining commits together is a process called squashing. Let's look at how to do that!



### Recap
As simple as at may seem, working on an active pull request is mostly about communication!

If the project's maintainer is requesting changes to the pull request, then:

* make any necessary commits on the same branch in your local repository that your pull request is based on
* push the branch to the your fork of the source repository

The commits will then show up on the pull request page.


## Squash Commits

### Squashing
> Squashing is just taking a number of commits and combining them into one single commit.

To squash commits together, we're going to use the extremely powerful git rebase command. This is one of my favorite commands, but it did take me quite a while to become comfortable with it. At first, it was somewhat challenging for me to get a handle on how it works, and then (after reading countless warnings online) I was scared to actually use it for fear of irreparably damaging my project's Git history.

But I'm here to tell you that git rebase isn't really all that difficult, and that you can bravely make changes to your repository without fear of doing any damage! 

    $ git rebase -i HEAD~3


### The Rebase Command
The git rebase command will move commits to have a new base. In the command git rebase -i HEAD~3, we're telling Git to use HEAD~3 as the base where all of the other commits (HEAD~2, HEAD~1, and HEAD) will connect to.

The -i in the command stands for "interactive". You can perform a rebase in a non-interactive mode. While you're learning how to rebase, though, I definitely recommend that you do interactive rebasing.

### Ancestry References
As a brief refresher, HEAD indicates your current location (it could point to several things, but typically it'll either point to a branch name or directly to a commit's SHA). The ~3 part means "three before", so HEAD~3 will be the commit that's three before the one you're currently on. We're using this relative reference to a commit in the git rebase command.


### Force Pushing
In the video, I had to force push the branch. I had to do this because GitHub was trying to prevent me from accidentally deleting commits. Because I used the git rebase command, I effectively erased the three separate commits that recorded my addition of Florida, Paris, and Scotland. I used git rebase to combine or squash all of these commits into one, single commit.

Using git rebase creates a new commit with a new SHA. When I tried using git push to send this commit up to GitHub, GitHub knew that accepting the push would erase the three separate commits, so it rejected it. So I had to force push the commits through using git push -f.

### ⚠️ Force Pushing ⚠️

> In this instance, force pushing my commits was necessary. But if you try to push commits and GitHub rejects them, it's trying to help you, so make sure to review what commits you're pushing and the commits that are on GitHub to verify you're not about to overwrite content on your remote repository accidentally!

### Rebase Commands
Let's take another look at the different commands that you can do with git rebase:

* use p or pick – to keep the commit as is
* use r or reword – to keep the commit's content but alter the commit message
* use e or edit – to keep the commit's content but stop before committing so that you can:
  * add new content or files
  * remove content or files
  * alter the content that was going to be committed
* use s or squash – to combine this commit's changes into the previous commit (the commit above it in the list)
* use f or fixup – to combine this commit's change into the previous one but drop the commit message
* use x or exec – to run a shell command
* use d or drop – to delete the commit


### When to rebase
As you've seen, the git rebase command is incredibly powerful. It can help you edit commit messages, reorder commits, combine commits, etc. So it truly is a powerhouse of a tool. Now the question becomes "When should you rebase?".

Whenever you rebase commits, Git will create a new SHA for each commit! This has drastic implications. To Git, the SHA is the identifier for a commit, so a different identifier means it's a different commit, regardless if the content has changed at all.

So you should not rebase if you have already pushed the commits you want to rebase. If you're collaborating with other developers, then they might already be working with the commits you've pushed. If you then use git rebase to change things around and then force push the commits, then the other developers will now be out of sync with the remote repository. They will have to do some complicated surgery to their Git repository to get their repo back in a working state...and it might not even be possible for them to do that; they might just have to scrap all of their work and start over with your newly-rebased, force-pushed commits.

###  Recap
The git rebase command is used to do a great many things.

    # interactive rebase
    $ git rebase -i <base>

    # interactively rebase the commits to the one that's 3 before the one we're on
    $ git rebase -i HEAD~3

Inside the interactive list of commits, all commits start out as pick, but you can swap that out with one of the other commands (reword, edit, squash, fixup, exec, and drop).

I recommend that you create a backup branch before rebasing, so that it's easy to return to your previous state. If you're happy with the rebase, then you can just delete the backup branch!
