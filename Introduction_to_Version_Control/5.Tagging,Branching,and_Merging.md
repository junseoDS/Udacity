## Intro

### git tag
> Add tags to specific commits

### git branch
> Allows multiple lines of developmet

### git checkout
> Switch between different bracnches and tag

### git merge
> Combines changes on diffrent branches



## Tagging

### Git Tag Command
Pay attention to what's shown (just the SHA and the commit message)

The command we'll be using to interact with the repository's tags is the git tag command:

    $ git tag -a v1.0

This will open your code editor and wait for you to supply a message for the tag. How about the message "Ready for content"?

? CAREFUL: In the command above (git tag -a v1.0) the -a flag is used. This flag tells Git to create an annotated flag. If you don't provide the flag (i.e. git tag v1.0) then it'll create what's called a lightweight tag.

>Annotated tags are recommended because they include a lot of extra information such as:
>
> * the person who made the tag
> * the date the tag was made
> * a message for the tag

>Because of this, you should always use annotated tags.

### Git Log's --decorate Flag
As you've learned, git log is a pretty powerful tool for letting us check out a repository's commits. We've already looked at a couple of its flags, but it's time to add a new one to our toolbelt. The --decorate flag will show us some details that are hidden from the default view.

Try running git log --decorate now!

> 💡 --decorate Flag Changes in Git 2.13 💡
>In the 2.13 update to Git, the log command has changed to automatically enable the --decorate flag. This means that you do not need to include the --decorate flag in your command, since it is automatically included, anyway! So the following commands result in the exact same output:

    $ git log --decorate
    $ git log


### Deleting A Tag
What if you accidentally misspelled something in the tag's message, or mistyped the actual tag name (v0.1 instead of v1.0). How could you fix this? The easiest way is just to delete the tag and make a new one.

A Git tag can be deleted with the -d flag (for delete!) and the name of the tag:

    $ git tag -d v1.0


### Adding A Tag To A Past Commit
Running git tag -a v1.0 will tag the most recent commit. But what if you wanted to tag a commit that occurred farther back in the repo's history?

All you have to do is provide the SHA of the commit you want to tag!

    $ git tag -a v1.0 a87984


## Branching

### The git branch command
The git branch command is used to interact with Git's branches:

    $ git branch

It can be used to:

* list all branch names in the repository
* create new branches
* delete branches

### Create A Branch
To create a branch, all you have to do is use git branch and provide it the name of the branch you want it to create. So if you want a branch called "sidebar", you'd run this command:

    $ git branch sidebar


### The git checkout Command
Remember that when a commit is made that it will be added to the current branch. So even though we created the new sidebar, no new commits will be added to it since we haven't switched to it, yet. If we made a commit right now, that commit would be added to the master branch, not the sidebar branch. We've already seen this in the demo, but to switch between branches, we need to use Git's checkout command.

    $ git checkout sidebar

It's important to understand how this command works. Running this command will:

* remove all files and directories from the Working Directory that Git is tracking
  * (files that Git tracks are stored in the repository, so nothing is lost)
* go into the repository and pull out all of the files and directories of the commit that the branch points to

So this will remove all of the files that are referenced by commits in the master branch. It will replace them with the files that are referenced by the commits in the sidebar branch. This is very important to understand, so go back and read these last two sentences.

### Branches In The Log
The branch information in the command prompt is helpful, but the clearest way to see it is by looking at the output of git log. But just like we had to use the --decorate flag to display Git tags, we need it to display branches.

    $ git log --oneline --decorate

### The Active Branch
The command prompt will display the active branch. But this is a special customization we made to our prompt. If you find yourself on a different computer, the fastest way to determine the active branch is to look at the output of the git branch command. An asterisk will appear next to the name of the active branch.

### Delete A Branch
A branch is used to do development or make a fix to the project that won't affect the project (since the changes are made on a branch). Once you make the change on the branch, you can combine that branch into the master branch (this "combining of branches" is called "merging" and we'll look at it shortly).

Now after a branch's changes have been merged, you probably won't need the branch anymore. If you want to delete the branch, you'd use the -d flag. The command below includes the -d flag which tells Git to delete the provided branch (in this case, the "sidebar" branch).

    $ git branch -d sidebar


One thing to note is that you can't delete a branch that you're currently on. So to delete the sidebar branch, you'd have to switch to either the master branch or create and switch to a new branch.

## Branching Effectively

First, make sure we're on the same page and have the same starter code. We're going to be working in the new-git-project project. The project has the following files:

* index.html
* css/app.css (empty)
* js/app.js (empty)

The CSS and JavaScript files are empty. Make sure the index file has the following content:

    <!doctype html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title>Blog Project</title>
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
        <meta name="description" content="">
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/app.css">
    </head>
    <body>

        <header>
            <h1>Expedition</h1>
        </header>

        <div class="container">
            <main>

            </main>
        </div>

        <footer>
            Made with ♥ @ Udacity
        </footer>
        <script src="js/app.js"></script>
    </body>
    </html>



### The Game Plan
Right now we have all of our code on the master branch (which is the default branch). We're about to work with branches, by:

* adding content to them
* creating new branches
* switching back and forth between them


Let's use branches to make the following changes:

1. on the master branch - add a default color to the page
2. create a sidebar branch - create a sidebar for the page
3. on the master branch - change the heading of the page
4. on the sidebar branch - add more content to the sidebar
5. create a footer branch - add social links to the footer

### Change 1 - Add Page Color
Make sure you're on the master branch and add the following content to css/app.css:

        body {
            background-color: #00cae4;
        }

Save the file. Then add the file to the staging index and commit it to the repository.


### Change 2 - Add Sidebar
Let's add a sidebar to the page. But let's say that we're not really sure if we like the new background color. So we'll place the sidebar branch on the commit before the one that sets the page's color. Your SHAs will be different, but, for me, the commit that's before the one that adds the color has a SHA of 5bfe5e7. So adding the branch to that commit would look like:

    $ git branch sidebar 5bfe5e7

Now use the git checkout command to switch to the new sidebar branch.



Create a sidebar by adding the following <aside> code to the HTML file:

    <div class="container">
        <main>

        </main>
    </div>

    <!-- start of new content -->
    <aside>
        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Eos, debitis earum molestias veniam suscipit aliquam totam exercitationem tempore neque vitae. Minima, corporis pariatur facere at quo porro beatae similique! Odit.</p>
    </aside>
    <!-- end of new content -->

    <footer>
        Made with ♥ @ Udacity
    </footer>

I added my <aside> content next to the <main> element as a fellow child of the <div class="container"> element.


### Change 3 - Change Heading On Master
Let's switch back to the master branch and update the page heading.

Use the git checkout command to switch back to the master branch. (Notice that the HTML for the new sidebar is no longer there(!) because all that code is stored safely on the sidebar branch.)

Now change the <h1> heading of the page from "Expedition" to something else. How about something exciting like the word "Adventure"!?!
    

### Change 4 - Add More Content To Sidebar
Switch back to the sidebar branch (notice, again, that content we've added to the master branch isn't visible on the sidebar branch).

Now just add some content inside the <aside> element. Add something about yourself - your favorite movie or book (my favorite is LOTR!). Anything will work, you just need to add some content.

Again, make sure that you do not make changes to the CSS file.

Now save the index.html file and make a commit.

### Change 5 - Add Social Links To Footer
We've made a number of changes, and we're about to make our last one. Let's add some social icons to the page's footer. For grins and giggles, let's make this change on a new footer branch that's based off the master branch. So we need to create a new footer branch, first.

## 💡 Switch and Create Branch In One Command💡

> The way we currently work with branches is to create a branch with the git branch command and then switch to that newly created branch with the git checkout command.

> But did you know that the git checkout command can actually create a new branch, too? If you provide the -b flag, you can create a branch and switch to it all in one command.

    $ git checkout -b richards-branch-for-awesome-changes
    
    
### Add Social Links
Now that we're on a new branch, let's add some social links to the page's footer. I've added the following content:

    <footer>
        <!-- start of new content -->
        <section>
            <h3 class="visuallyhidden">Social Links</h3>
            <a class="social-link" href="https://twitter.com/udacity">
                <img src="img/social-twitter.png" alt="Twitter">
            </a>
            <a class="social-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/udacity/">
                <img src="img/social-instagram.png" alt="Instagram">
            </a>
            <a class="social-link" href="https://plus.google.com/+Udacity">
                <img src="img/social-google.png" alt="Google Plus">
            </a>
        </section>
        <!-- end of new content -->
    </footer>

### See All Branches At Once
We've made it to the end of all the changes we needed to make! Awesome job!

Now we have multiple sets of changes on three different branches. We can't see other branches in the git log output unless we switch to a branch. Wouldn't it be nice if we could see all branches at once in the git log output.

As you've hopefully learned by now, the git log command is pretty powerful and can show us this information. We'll use the new --graph and --all flags:

    $ git log --oneline --decorate --graph --all

The --graph flag adds the bullets and lines to the leftmost part of the output. This shows the actual branching that's happening. The --all flag is what displays all of the branches in the repository.


### Recap Of Changes
We've made the following changes:

on the master branch, we added a default color to the page
we created a sidebar branch and added code for a sidebar
on the master branch, we changed the heading of the page
on the sidebar branch, we added more content to the sidebar
we created a footer branch and added social links to the footer
These changes are all on their own, separate branches. Let's have Git combine these changes together. Combining branches together is called merging.


## Merging

Combining branches together is called merging.

Git can automatically merge the changes on different branches together. This branching and merging ability is what makes Git incredibly powerful! You can make small or extensive changes on branches, and then just use Git to combine those changes together.

 Pay attention to the two main types of merges in Git, a regular merge and a Fast-forward merge.


## ⚠️ Know The Branch ⚠️
> It's very important to know which branch you're on when you're about to merge branches together. Remember that making a merge makes a commit.

> As of right now, we do not know how to undo changes. We'll go over it in the next lesson, but if you make a merge on the wrong branch, use this command to undo the merge:

    git reset --hard HEAD^

> (Make sure to include the ^ character! It's a known as a "Relative Commit Reference" and indicates "the parent commit". We'll look at Relative Commit References in the next lesson.)


### The Merge Command
The git merge command is used to combine Git branches:

    $ git merge <name-of-branch-to-merge-in>
When a merge happens, Git will:

* look at the branches that it's going to merge
* look back along the branch's history to find a single commit that both branches have in their commit history
* combine the lines of code that were changed on the separate branches together
* makes a commit to record the merge

### Fast-forward Merge
In our project, I've checked out the master branch and I want _it_ to have the changes that are on the footer branch. If I wanted to verbalize this, I could say this is - "I want to merge in the footer branch". That "merge in" is important; when a merge is performed, the other branch's changes are brought into the branch that's currently checked out.

Let me stress that again - When we merge, we're merging some other branch into the current (checked-out) branch. We're not merging two branches into a new branch. We're not merging the current branch into the other branch.

Now, since footer is directly ahead of master, this merge is one of the easiest merges to do. Merging footer into master will cause a Fast-forward merge. A Fast-forward merge will just move the currently checked out branch forward until it points to the same commit that the other branch (in this case, footer) is pointing to.

To merge in the footer branch, run:

    $ git merge footer


### Perform A Regular Merge
Fantastic work doing a Fast-forward merge! That wasn't too hard, was it?

But you might say - "Of course that was easy, all of the commits are already there and the branch pointer just moved forward!"...and you'd be right. It's the simplest of merges.

So let's do the more common kind of merge where two divergent branches are combined. You'll be surprised that to merge in a divergent branch like sidebar is actually no different!

To merge in the sidebar branch, make sure you're on the master branch and run:

    $ git merge sidebar


Because this combines two divergent branches, a commit is going to be made. And when a commit is made, a commit message needs to be supplied. Since this is a merge commit a default message is already supplied. You can change the message if you want, but it's common practice to use the default merge commit message. So when your code editor opens with the message, just close it again and accept that commit message.

### What If A Merge Fails?
The merges we just did were able to merge successfully. Git is able to intelligently combine lots of work on different branches. However, there are times when it can't combine branches together. When a merge is performed and fails, that is called a merge conflict. We'll look at merge conflicts, what causes them, and how to resolve them in the next lesson.

### Merge Recap
To recap, the git merge command is used to combine branches in Git:

    $ git merge <other-branch>

There are two types of merges:

* Fast-forward merge – the branch being merged in must be ahead of the checked out branch. The checked out branch's pointer will just be moved forward to point to the same commit as the other branch.
* the regular type of merge
    * two divergent branches are combined
    * a merge commit is created




## Merge Conflicts

### Sometimes Merges Fail
Most of the time Git will be able to merge branches together without any problem. However, there are instances when a merge cannot be fully performed automatically. When a merge fails, it's called a merge conflict.

If a merge conflict does occur, Git will try to combine as much as it can, but then it will leave special markers (e.g. >>> and <<<) that tell you where you (yep, you the programmer!) needs to manually fix.

### What Causes A Merge Conflict
As you've learned, Git tracks lines in files. A merge conflict will happen when the exact same line(s) are changed in separate branches. For example, if you're on a alternate-sidebar-style branch and change the sidebar's heading to "About Me" but then on a different branch and change the sidebar's heading to "Information About Me", which heading should Git choose? You've changed the heading on both branches, so there's no way Git will know which one you actually want to keep. And it sure isn't going to just randomly pick for you!

Let's force a merge conflict so we can learn to resolve it. Trust me, it's simple once you get the hang of it! Remember that a merge conflict occurs when Git isn't sure which line(s) you want to use from the branches that are being merged. So we need to edit the same line on two different branches...and then try to merge them.

### Forcing A Merge Conflict!
Remember that a merge conflict occurs when the exact same line(s) are changed in separate branches. Let's alter the page's heading on two different branches. So Let's:

* change the heading on the master branch
* create a heading-update branch that's located on the commit right before the recently modified master branch
* change the same heading
* switch back to the master branch
* merge in the heading-update branch


### Change Heading On Branch 1
Since the master branch is just a regular ol' branch like all the rest, let's just alter the heading while we're on the master branch. So change the <h1> heading from whatever you have it to something else. For me, the heading is currently "Adventure" on line 13, and I'm changing it to "Quest".

Once you've made the change, save the file and commit it to the repository.

### Change Heading On Branch 2
Now we need to create a different branch and update the heading on that branch.

Now this is important, we need to create a branch that's not branching from the master branch. If we make a change that branches off of the master branch, then that change will be "ahead" of this one and Git will just use that change instead of the one we just made on master. So we need to put the branch "in the past".

Let's just create a branch that's on the commit right before the most recent one. So use Git log to get the previous commit's SHA and create a branch on that commit.
