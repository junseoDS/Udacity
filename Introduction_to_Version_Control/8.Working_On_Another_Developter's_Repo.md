## Intro

### Forking a repository

### Reviewing another developer's changes

### Knowing what changes to make


## Forking A Repository

### Fork
> To split into an identical copy

> make a copy of that repository and bring it over to my own account.


### Push/Pull To The Fork
Because forking a repository gives you a copy of it in your account, you can clone at down to your computer, make changes to it, and then push those changes back to the forked repository. But you need to keep in mind that it'll be pushing the changes back to your remote repository not to the original remote repository that you forked from.

### Recap
Forking is an action that's done on a hosting service, like GitHub. Forking a repository creates an identical copy of the original repository and moves this copy to your account. You have total control over this forked repository. Modifying your forked repository does not alter the original repository in any way.
